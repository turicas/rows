No matter in which format your tabular data is: rows will import it,
automatically detect types and give you high-level Python objects so you can
start working with the data instead of trying to parse it. It is also
locale-and-unicode aware. :)

Read the documentation and learn how simple is to use it: http://turicas.info/rows
