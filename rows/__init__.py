About
-----

No matter in which format your tabular data is: rows will import it,
automatically detect types and give you high-level Python objects so you can
start working with the data instead of trying to parse it. It is also
locale-and-unicode aware. :)

Architecture
-------------

The library is composed by:

* A common interface to tabular data (the Table class)
* A set of plugins to populate Table objects (CSV, XLS, HTML, TXT, JSON, SQLite
  -- more coming soon!)
* A set of common fields (such as BoolField, IntegerField) which know exactly
  how to serialize and deserialize data for each object type you'll get
* A set of utilities (such as field type recognition) to help working with
  tabular data
* A command-line interface so you can have easy access to the most used
  features: convert between formats, sum, join and sort tables.
